* tab-bookmark.el - Use bookmarks to persist tabs

This package provides commands which allow storing the window configuration of
the current tab as an Emacs bookmark. This way the view is automatically
persisted and can be restored after restart.

This package is a more capable variant of my [[https://github.com/minad/bookmark-view][bookmark-view]]. However it is
assumes that you use =tab-bar-mode=.
